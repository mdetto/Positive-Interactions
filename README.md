# Positive-Interactions

Positive Interactions is a collection of R scripts to compute the Species Individual Relationships (SIR) from mapped forest inventory data. It includes four files.

R Code 1: ISAR.r - Script for computing the number of individuals (N) and the number of species richness (S) around all stems, “ISAR”.

R Code 2: RNA.RNS.r - Script for calculating the relative neighborhood abundance and richness for trees within a 60 m circular neighborhood of the focal species and falling within the same diameter at breast height (DBH) class as the focal tree, “RNN.RNS”.

R Code 3: LocalRLNullMode.r  | Script for local random labeling (LRL) null model test.

Additional scripts

R Code 4: AnalyticalNullModel.r - Script for analytical tests based on two null models, Random Labeling (RL) model and Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) model.
